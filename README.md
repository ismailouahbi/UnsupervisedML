# UnsupervisedML

## Description
This repository, created by Ismail Ouahbi, contains various implementations of unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The main file in this repository is a Jupyter notebook named "Clustering algorithms (testing & comparing)".

## Objective of the Analysis
The main objective of the analysis is to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. The sample dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

## Steps
1. **Business Understanding**: Define the problem and desired outcomes.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the data, find patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions.
3. **Outlier Detection**: Identify unusual data points in the dataset.
   - **Via Visualizations**: Use graphical representations of the data to identify potential outliers.
     1. **Univariate Outlier Detection**: Detect outliers in one variable.
     2. **Multivariate Outlier Detection**: Detect outliers in multiple variables.
   - **Via Statistics**: Use statistical measures to identify potential outliers.
